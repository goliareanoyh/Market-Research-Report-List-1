<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spandex Fabric Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solution Dry Spinning</li><li>Solution Wet Spinning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spandex fabric market is primarily categorized into two types based on the spinning processes used: solution dry spinning and solution wet spinning. In solution dry spinning, the polymer solution is extruded through spinnerets and then dried, resulting in lightweight and elastic fibers. Conversely, solution wet spinning involves dissolving the polymer in a solvent, extruding it into a coagulation bath where the fibers solidify. Both methods produce high-stretch, durable fabrics widely used in apparel, activewear, and hosiery.</p></p>
