<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blow Molding Components Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Extrusion</li><li>Injection</li><li>Stretch</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Blow molding is a manufacturing process for producing hollow plastic parts, with three main types: extrusion, injection, and stretch blow molding. </p><p>Extrusion blow molding involves melting plastic and forming it into a parison, which is then inflated within a mold. Injection blow molding combines injection molding to create a preform and then inflates it in a mold. Stretch blow molding is typically used for producing lightweight bottles, stretching the preform during inflation for enhanced clarity and strength. Each method caters to specific applications and material requirements.</p></p>
