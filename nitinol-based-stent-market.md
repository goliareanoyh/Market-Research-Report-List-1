<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Nitinol based Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bare-metal Stent (BMS)</li><li>Drug-eluting Stent (DES)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Nitinol-based stent market includes two primary types: Bare-metal Stent (BMS) and Drug-eluting Stent (DES). BMS are simple metal structures that provide support to blood vessels but do not deliver medication, making them suitable for patients without complex health issues. In contrast, DES are coated with drugs designed to prevent re-narrowing of arteries, enhancing healing and longevity. Both types leverage Nitinol's unique properties, offering flexibility and biocompatibility, catering to diverse clinical needs in vascular interventions.</p></p>
