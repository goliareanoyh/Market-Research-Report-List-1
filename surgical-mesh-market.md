<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Mesh Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Absorbable Surgical Mesh</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical mesh market is categorized into three main types: non-absorbable surgical mesh, absorbable surgical mesh, and others. Non-absorbable surgical mesh is designed for long-term support and remains in the body indefinitely, commonly used in hernia repair and pelvic floor surgeries. Absorbable surgical mesh, on the other hand, is engineered to degrade and be absorbed by the body over time, making it suitable for temporary support in surgeries where gradual healing is expected. The "others" category may include specialized or hybrid materials that combine features of both types or serve niche applications.</p></p>
